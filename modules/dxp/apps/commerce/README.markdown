# Liferay Commerce Project / *Developer Preview*

Liferay Commerce Project is an open-source e-commerce platform written in Java.

It was built from the ground up to work with the [Liferay Digital Experience Platform](https://www.liferay.com/digital-experience-platform) which provides enterprise-grade web experience management and best-in-breed portal capabilities.

> **Attention:** This project is currently in a *Developer Preview* phase, which means it should only be used for test purposes. A stable version that is ready for production will be released in the next few months.

## Why?

While Liferay customers can use the platform to build marketing sites, customer portals, and intranets, they do not have an integrated Liferay product that helps them build modern digital commerce sites.

Liferay Commerce Project is here not only to bridge that gap, but also to provide sellers the most complete platform to attract, convert and retain customers.
